# E-commerce Sales Analysis
## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce behavior data using advanced big data technologies. Leveraging PySpark on AWS Databricks, we've processed over 42 million records to extract meaningful insights, guiding businesses to strategic decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
### PySpark: 
Utilized for its in-memory data processing capabilities within Python.
### AWS Databricks: 
Served as the unified data analytics platform.
### Amazon S3: 
Used for secure, scalable object storage of the dataset.
### Amazon EC2: 
Provided resizable compute capacity for processing.
### Jupyter Notebooks: 
Facilitated code execution and data visualization.
### Matplotlib: 
Used for creating comprehensive visualizations.

## Installation and Setup

### PySpark:
Install PySpark using `pip install pyspark`.
Ensure Java 8 or higher is installed on your system.

### Databricks CLI:
Install using `pip install databricks-cli`.
Set up authentication with your Databricks workspace.

### Running the Project
If you are converting a `.py` Python script into a Databricks Jupyter notebook, and you plan to use the command indicated in the screenshot to denote that a cell is sourced from a Databricks notebook, your updated steps for running the project would be as follows:

1. **Set up an AWS S3 bucket to store the dataset**:
   - Create a new S3 bucket through the AWS Management Console.
   - Set the correct permissions to ensure that your Databricks cluster can access the data.

2. **Upload the dataset to the S3 bucket**:
   - Use the AWS CLI or Management Console to upload your dataset files to the created S3 bucket.

3. **Create and configure a Databricks workspace**:
   - Log in to the Databricks workspace.
   - Set up a new cluster with the appropriate configuration to handle your dataset.

4. **Convert your `.py` script to a Databricks-compatible Jupyter notebook**:
   - Create a new notebook in your Databricks workspace.
   - Use the `# Databricks notebook source` command at the start of the notebook.
   - Split your `.py` script into cells, preceded by `# COMMAND ----------` to denote separate executable cells.

5. **Use the Databricks notebook for development**:
   - Develop and test your code within the Databricks notebook environment, ensuring all PySpark functions work as expected.
   - Utilize the built-in version control in Databricks to keep track of changes.

6. **Run the notebook as a job on the Databricks cluster**:
   - Schedule the notebook to run as a job within Databricks.
   - Configure the job settings to specify the cluster and any necessary parameters.

7. **Process the data using PySpark on Databricks**:
   - Execute the notebook, which will process the data using PySpark on the cluster.

8. **Visualize the results**:
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn within the notebook to create visualizations.
   - The visualizations will be rendered directly within the Databricks notebook once the cells are executed.

9. **Monitor and Retrieve Results**:
   - Use the Databricks workspace to monitor the execution and view the results.
   - Export the notebook, visualizations, or processed data to your local system if necessary.
